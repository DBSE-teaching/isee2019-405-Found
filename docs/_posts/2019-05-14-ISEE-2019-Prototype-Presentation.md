### Requirement Gathering
<br />

During the weekly team meetings, every question formulated for a team member was collected, after that we processed them into a meeting agenda, which was a powerful tool that helped as to make the correct questions that later could be clarified by the customer.

Te customer was pretty sure about the requirements he had, and the fact the he cold manage to split them into "Required" and "Nice to have" helped us to establish priorities for the user stories, here we also mention some ideas we had for the project that were easily assign to one of the previously mentioned categories.



### Wrong assumptions identification

<br /> 
Taking as a starting point the fact that no all the requirements are gathered since the beginning, and also that some them are going to inevitably change, we tried to involve our customer as much as possible in the phase of requirement processing, this way he could see and make and early correction of every aspect that wasn't an actual requirement.<br />

<br /> 
Even though, we have as principle to work only on what is a requirement from our customer, we couldn't avoid to come across with some features that we thought were necessary to satisfy one of the requirements, we dealt we this assumptions remaking them within the respective user story that was later explained to the customer, so that he could approve or dismiss them. One example for this was the assumption of having a user account that can be used to log in on different devices, while de desire of the client was to have a PIN that could be used to access the application.

### Use case diagram

<br /> 

This diagram depicts the in high level the interactions that the user can have with the application, among them; **"Enter PIN"** used to get access to the application, which must be verified, **"Enter expense"** necessary to register the expenditure information, **"Enter income"** where the user must detail his/her incomes, **"Check dashboard"** used to monitor the user's finances, and **"Change settings"** where the user can establish preferences for the system.


### User Stories (Excel map pic)

In order to write the user stories, we took the requirements expressed by the customer using the "I need" phase, and turned them into small pieces of work expressed using the format *"as a [type of user], I want to [perform some task], so that I can [achieve some goal]"*; and for that goal we established some acceptance criteria that should be fulfilled in order to the user story to be complete.<br />
