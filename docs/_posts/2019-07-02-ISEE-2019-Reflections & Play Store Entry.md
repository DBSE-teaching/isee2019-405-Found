## Technical challenges our team encountered

<p class="justify">

In this project we worked together with people we never met before and who came from different backgrounds of engineering. For all of us it was a challenge and an adventure at the same time to develop an android application.

- Our previous experience with programming was not sufficient enough as to implement such a project of this importance. We faced difficulties in the beginning when trying to understand how android studio works. However our team had a very motivational spirit and together we encouraged each-other in learning more and with the time we became Android App developers.

- Beside programming in Java for the application, we had minor knowledge in building a Database and implementing it in Android Studio. After a lot of failures and testing, we managed to successfully implement and use the Database for our app thanks to our commitment and desire to improve.
