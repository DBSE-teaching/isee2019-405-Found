# Beta Prototype and Testing

<br>

<p class="justify"/>

Welcome to the fourth blog of team 405 Found - Money Control Application. In this blog we will give an overview of how we have put our application to test and which testing approach we have used.

An application is a product and products always serves the users in some ways or another.It is very important that our application brings the value that it promises, hence it should work properly to ensure great customer experience. Development of an app, has many processes and testing gets a glimpse of every bit – it checks if the apps graphics are aligned properly, tests the main functionality, checks if menus are intuitive, etc. After developers fix issues, sometimes another issue may appear unexpectedly somewhere else, that’s just how testing goes, so it’s great to find those issues to be resolved and deliver a quality product in the marketplace.

If we look into a more technical definition of software testing then according to ANSI/IEEE 1059 standard – Software testing is a process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between existing and required conditions (i.e., defects) and to evaluate the features of the software item.

There are several approarches to test your software, but the one we chose for our application is *Black Box Testing*.

## Black Box Testing

Black box testing is also called Behavioral/Specification-Based/Input-Output Testing. Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which testers evaluate the functionality of the software under test without looking at the internal code structure.

This method attempts to find errors in the following categories:

1) Incorrect or missing functions.

2) User interface errors.

3) Errors in data structures or external database access.

4) Behaviour or performance errors.

5) Initialization and termination errors.


### Advantages

Some of the advantages of black box testing are:


1) Tests are done from a user's perspective and will help in exposing any incompatibility in the specification of the software.

2) Tester doesn't need to know programming language or how the software has been implemented.

3) Test can be conducted by anybody independent from the developer'S team.

4) Test cases can be designed as soon as the specifications are complete.
