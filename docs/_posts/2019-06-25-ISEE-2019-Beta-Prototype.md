Welcome to the fourth blog of team 405 Found - Money Control Application. In this blog we will give an overview of how we have put our application to test and which testing approach we have used.

An application is a product and products always serves the users in some ways or another.It is very important that our application brings the value that it promises, hence it should work properly to ensure great customer experience. Development of an app, has many processes and testing gets a glimpse of every bit – it checks if the apps graphics are aligned properly, tests the main functionality, checks if menus are intuitive, etc. After developers fix issues, sometimes another issue may appear unexpectedly somewhere else, that’s just how testing goes, so it’s great to find those issues to be resolved and deliver a quality product in the marketplace.

If we look into a more technical definition of software testing then according to ANSI/IEEE 1059 standard – Software testing is a process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between existing and required conditions (i.e., defects) and to evaluate the features of the software item.

There are several approarches to test your software, but the one we chose for our application is *Black Box Testing*.
